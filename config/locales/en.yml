# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  welcome_view_faq_strong_four: "Does Truppie do truppies too?"

  welcome_view_faq_strong_nine: "Who should I refer to in case of questions about a specific truppie?"
  welcome_view_faq_strong_ten: "Can I register myself as a guide on Truppie?"
  welcome_view_faq_strong_eleven: "Can I book two truppies for the same day?"
  welcome_view_faq_p_one: "No. We are a platform that connects guides (independent or from local travel agencies) to people who seek for tours, trips and other types of experiences."
  welcome_view_faq_p_two: "Trip + Hippie + Troupe = Truppie <br /> A new concept of lifestyle and life philosophy."
  welcome_view_faq_p_three: "Any type of adventure/trip/tour that brings a new, enriching and inspiring experience. Something that contributes to your development as a human being."
  welcome_view_faq_p_four: "Not yet. Someday, who knows? In the meantime, it is merely the platform that supports the truppies organized by external guides."
  welcome_view_faq_p_five: "Truppie is the platform which external guides use to create their own truppies. The guides are responsible for the information provided, booking confirmation, payment, number of vacancies, cancellation etc - all done via Truppie website. The guide is the ultimate responsible for the event."
  welcome_view_faq_p_six: "For now, in Brazil, in the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais. But we have plans to expand to other regions."
  welcome_view_faq_p_seven: "On Truppie, you pay directly through the website with credit card. Once the payment is confirmed, your place is automatically reserved."
  welcome_view_faq_p_eight: "Each guide has their own reimbursement policy. It will be clearly stated in the event before you complete the payment."
  welcome_view_faq_p_nine: "The organizing guide is the person who knows best about their own truppie, so we recommend you contact them directly by e-mail or telephone (provided in the event page). Anyway, in case of any problems, Truppie will be glad to help too :) "
  welcome_view_faq_p_ten: "If you are any kind of guide (travel, nature, adventure, photography, yoga etc), either working independently or in an agency, and - very important - if you feel synergy between our values, you are welcome to join Truppie as our guide!"
  welcome_view_faq_p_eleven: "No. Once you commit with one guide, they are counting on your presence at their event. You cannot be in two places at the same time, right?"

  welcome_view_how_h3: "How it works"
  welcome_view_how_p_one: "Welcome to Truppie family! Have a better understanding of what is Truppie and how it works."
  welcome_view_how_h4_one: "What it is"
  welcome_view_how_p_two: "Truppie is a platform that connects people to many adventures."
  welcome_view_how_h4_two: "What we do"
  welcome_view_how_p_three: "Truppie came to take you out of normal life: school, work, bills, consumism, sedentary lifestyle, boredom, lack of purpose. Truppie is here to present you new possibilities of enjoying your time, feeding your soul and developing as a person. How? Having fun, discovering oneself, exploring new places, making new friends, living new experiences!"
  welcome_view_how_p_four: "We want to show that life can be much more interesting when we prioritize what really makes a difference,  what enriches our soul. There resides the key to the true happiness - dettach from material goods, be present and see beauty in each and every moment."
  welcome_view_how_p_five: "To sum up: Truppie does… truppies! Tours, trails, hikes, events, trips… for us, all kinds of adventures are called truppies. So, what is your truppie?"
  welcome_view_how_p_six: "...our brain is capable of forming new synapses (connection between nerve cells) when stimulated by new factos? This is called neuroplasticity. That means that when we explore and live new situations, we are learning, and our brain, developing. And this is one of the greatest contributors to creativity. So, not only living new adventures is distracting and pleasurable, it is also healthy and productive!"
  welcome_view_how_p_seven: "Truppie is made by people like you and me. It's people who love what they do on one side, and people who are in love with life on the other side. It's a lot of good energy all together!"
  welcome_view_how_p_eight: "The Guide can be an independent professional, or linked to some local agency. They sign up on the platform Truppie, create a profile and create how many truppies as they want. The Guides registration goes through a verification, in order for us to assure the quality of the services providers."
  welcome_view_how_p_nine: "The Explorer can be me, you, any person in search of a new experience. He/she signs up and also has a profile, with information about their preferences. The explorer finds their truppie, books and pays through the website."
  welcome_view_how_p_ten: "Truppie is the platform that connects the Explorer in quest for their next adventure and the Guide who offers it. The Guide creates their own events (aka 'truppies') on our website, which in turn gives the Explorer all the information, support and orientation they need in order to book their tour."
  welcome_view_how_p_eleven: "No bureaucracy, no difficulty, with transparency, from our hearts."
  welcome_view_how_p_twelve: "The truppies are offered by the Guides registered in our platform; they provide all the necessary information so that the Explorer can book the tour straight from the website: date, place, duratino, price, pre-requisites, physical difficulty, required equipments, vacancies, etc."
  welcome_view_how_p_thirteen: "If there are questions specifically about the event, the Explorer should contact the Guide. If it's a more general question (eg: about different truppies or guides), Truppie is always at your disposal."
  welcome_view_how_p_fourteen: "Once the Explorer chooses their truppie, the payment is easily made on the website with credit card; and then, voilà, the truppie is booked!"
  welcome_view_how_p_fifteen: "In case the Guide cancels the event, the Explorer has two options: 1) refund of 100%  or 2) leave the credit with the Guide to be used in a future truppie of their own choice."
  welcome_view_how_p_sixteen: "Truppie gives the guides freedom to create and manage their own events; they are responsible for booking confirmation, payment, number of vacancies and cancellation. Even though the ultimate responsibility for the event resides with the organizing Guide, Truppie will help with whatever is possible in order to provide the Explorer with the best experience."
  welcome_view_how_p_seventeen: "To sum up: whether you are a Guide or an Explorer, Truppie wants to make things easy for you, so that more people can have the best experiences of their lives! :)"
